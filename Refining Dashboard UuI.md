### Planner Response

I see you typed "CI SEI'" - this looks like it might be a typo or incomplete message. Could you clarify what you'd like me to help with? 

Based on your recent work, are you looking to:
1. Continue refining the Karion Trading OS dashboard UI?
2. Fix something specific in the `DashboardPage.jsx` file you have open?
3. Something else entirely?

### Planner Response

I'll continue the work on the Karion Trading OS dashboard. Let me first check the current state of the project and what was accomplished in the previous session.

### Planner Response

Based on my review of the previous session, I can see what was accomplished and what remains. The task.md shows outstanding items:

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. **Chart Screening Panel**: 
   - ❌ Implement zoom in/out on hover (currently click-based)
   - ❌ Use real statistics from backend data

2. **COT Panel**:
   - ❌ Add historical position charts

3. **Options Flow Panel**:
   - 🔄 Enhance with more data points (in progress)
   - ❌ Add volume, IV, Greeks displays
   - ❌ Make expandable like COT
   - ❌ Add filtering capabilities

Which of these areas would you like me to continue working on? Here are my suggestions:

1. **Chart Screening - Hover Zoom**: Add smooth hover-based zoom/focus instead of just click
2. **COT Historical Charts**: Add mini sparkline charts showing position changes over time
3. **Options Panel Enhancement**: Complete the Options Flow panel with more professional data

Let me know your priority, or I can start with the most impactful improvement (I'd suggest enhancing the Options Flow panel to match the quality of the COT panel).
